<h1>The Ugly Duckling</h1>
<h2>Hans Christian Andersen</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, <font color="green" size="14"><u>in a sunny farmyard</u></font>, a <font color="violet" size="14"><b>mother duck</b></font> sat patiently on her eggs, waiting for them to hatch. One by one, the eggs cracked open, and <font color="violet" size="14"><b>little fluffy ducklings</b></font> came out, all yellow and cute—except for one. The last egg hatched late, and out came <font color="violet" size="14"><b>a big, awkward, gray bird</b></font>. <font color="red" size="14"><sup>He was much bigger than his brothers and sisters, and he looked very different. The other animals laughed at him. “You’re so ugly!” they said. “You don’t belong here!” The ugly duckling felt sad and lonely. He tried to play with the other ducklings, but they would not let him join in. Even the other animals made fun of him. So, he ran away from the farm to find a place where he could fit in. As the ugly duckling wandered through fields and woods, he met many animals. But none of them wanted him around. He was cold and hungry, and he wished he could be beautiful like the other birds.</sup></font> Winter came, and the ugly duckling struggled to survive. <font color="blue" size="14"><sub>But when spring finally arrived, something magical happened. He saw a group of graceful, shining swans swimming on a pond. Feeling curious, the ugly duckling approached the water and looked at his reflection. To his surprise, he was no longer ugly. He had grown into a beautiful swan with white feathers and a long neck! The other swans welcomed him warmly, and the ugly duckling—now a magnificent swan—felt happy and loved at last.</sub></font> <font color="yellow" size="14"><em>Sometimes, we may feel out of place or different, but with time, we grow into who we are meant to be. True beauty shines from within and becomes clear when the time is right.</em></font><p>
